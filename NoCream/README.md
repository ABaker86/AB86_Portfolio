Animal Info
-----------
Animal Info is a simple swing application created as an AIU assignment for displaying inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. The application allows the user to select one of three buttons and have the contents of a ```dipalyInfo()``` method to be printed to a textArea. There are four classes: 
* [] AnimalInfo GUI
* [] Animal     SuperClass
* [] lion       Subclass of Animal
* [] tiger      Subclass of Animal
* [] bear       Subclass of Animal
Each subclass extends the Animal class and overrides the ```displayInfo()``` method.
