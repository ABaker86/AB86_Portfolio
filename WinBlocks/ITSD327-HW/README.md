==========

The Application of Scripting Language course required the learning of PowerShellv3. In addition to course work I took it upon myself to look into the new Microsoft Virtual Academy (MVA) and went through the `Getting Started with PowerShell 3.0 Jump Start` and `Advanced Tools and Scripting with PowerShell 3.0 Jump Start`. 

The course and MVA helped me to understand how to go about automating administrative tasks with PowerShell.
